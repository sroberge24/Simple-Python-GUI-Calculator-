# Simple-Python-GUI-Calculator-
This Python project is a basic calculator built with the Tkinter GUI library. The simple calculations that can be used include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
The GUI interface is simple and clean allowing for an easy interface for users to calculate math equations. 
The calculator uses global variables, stringvar(), btnclear, and other functions that allow for quick inputs and outputs of code. 
Some functions used are btn_click(), btn_equal(), and then the eval() to calculate the desired request. 
The code also features basic error handling in order to manage invalid inputs without crashing.
